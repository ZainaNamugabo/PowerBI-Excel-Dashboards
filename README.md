# ðŸ“Š End-to-End Business Dashboards (Power BI & Excel)

Welcome to my **Data Analytics Dashboard Portfolio**, where I showcase **interactive and dynamic dashboards** built using **Power BI** and **Microsoft Excel**. These dashboards are the product of a complete data workflowâ€”from **ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)** processes to insightful data visualization.

Each project in this repository reflects my ability to **clean, structure, analyze, and visualize data** to support meaningful and data-driven business decisions.

## ðŸš€ What This Repository Includes

### ðŸ”§ **ETL Process**
I managed the full ETL pipeline for each dashboard:
- **Extract**: Collected raw data from CSVs, Excel sheets, and simulated databases.
- **Transform**: Cleaned, formatted, normalized, and enriched the data using Power Query (M language) and Excel functions.
- **Load**: Integrated transformed data into Power BI data models and Excel PivotTables for efficient reporting.
